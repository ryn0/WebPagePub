For the given keyword/ phrase: "[keyword]" create an SEO friendly URL key. 

The URL key must represent the main intent of the search so that duplicate articles on this topic are not created.

A URL key for the question: "How many feet are in a mile" would be formatted as: "feet-in-mile".

Only respond with the URL key, nothing else.
